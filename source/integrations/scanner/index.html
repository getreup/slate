                        <h1>App Scanner Integration Guidelines</h1>
<p>
  This document is to supply guidelines around an integration of third party
  scanners for ReUp's custom mobile payment and loyalty apps.
  It is aimed to discuss overall user interface flow and business logic.
</p>

<p>
  In the context of this document, an <b>App</b> refers to a
  ReUp mobile payments and loyalty iOS or Android app.
</p>

<p>
  In the context of this document, the <b>Customer</b> refers to an App user.
  The Customer has already downloaded the Vendor's app, connected a payment
  method, and, if live pay is disabled, load credit onto their app.
</p>

<p>
  In the context of this document, a <b>Vendor</b> represents a store owner or clerk
  who is responsible for taking their customer's order. They will be the
  primary user of the Scanner.
</p>

<p>
  In the context of this document, a <b>Scanner</b> refers to the application
  which scans an App to perform a transaction. A Vendor's Customer presents one
  of their App's QR codes to be scanned with the Scanner. Context is built into
  the QR code determining what action the scanner should take. To complete the
  transaction, the Scanner is to reach out to the ReUp Scanner API, found
  <a href="http://apidocs.getreup.com/scanner/V4.0/">here</a>.
</p>

<div id="AppCredit" class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-12">
  <h2>App Credit Only Transaction</h2>
  <p>
    The role of the Scanner in an App credit only transaction is to allow the Customer to
    use their App credit (or in the case of Live Pay, their connected payment
    method) to purchase goods in store.
  </p>
  <p>
    An App credit only transaction should consist of the following interactions:
  </p>
  <div><p><img src="img/Diagram-02.png" height="200"></p></div>
  <ol type="1">

    <li>
      Customer's order is taken
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Customer communicates their order to the Vendor</li>
        <li>Vendor inputs their order on the point of sale</li>
        <li>Vendor communicates the total amount to the Customer</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      Customer presents App for payment
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Customer navigates to the Use Credit feature on their App</li>
        <li>Customer presents the <a href="http://apidocs.getreup.com/scanner/V4.0/#pay-with-credit">Use Credit QR Code</a></li>
        <li>Vendor scans the QR code with their Scanner</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      Vendor executes transaction
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          If the POS and Scanner are not integrated, the Vendor inputs the total
          dollar amount on the Scanner.
        </li>
        <li>Scanner performs the
          <a href="http://apidocs.getreup.com/scanner/V4.0/#pay-with-credit16">UseCredit</a>
          method on the ReUp Scanner API
        </li>
        <li>
          If the transaction is a success, the purchase has been paid for
          and the Vendor should now supply the Customer with their order.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the transaction fails, the Vendor should communicate this to the
          Customer by supplying their current credit amount compared to how much the
          goods cost.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    During each step above, the Vendor should be supplied with sufficient and
    very obvious information about the transaction, so they can properly
    communicate that to the Customer.
  </p>

<div id="AppReward" class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-12">
  <h2>App Reward Only Transaction</h2>
  <p>
    The role of the Scanner in a reward only transaction is to allow the Customer to
    redeem their App points for predetermined goods or discounts in store.
  </p>
  <p>
    An App reward only transaction should consist of the following interactions:
  </p>
  <div><p><img src="img/Diagram-02.png" height="200"></p></div>

      Customer requests to redeem a reward
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Customer navigates to the Redeem Reward feature on their App</li>

        <li>Vendor scans the QR code with their Scanner</li>
        <li>
          If the POS and Scanner are integrated, the Vendor passes the reward
          and invoice to the ReUp Scanner API via
          <a href="http://apidocs.getreup.com/scanner/V4.0/#evaluate-a-reward">EvaluateReward</a>
          and applies a negative line item representing one of the returned
          Qualified Discounts.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      Vendor executes transaction
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          When the Customer is ready to pay, the Scanner redeems the reward by
          calling the <a href="http://apidocs.getreup.com/scanner/V4.0/#redeem-a-reward">RedeemReward</a>
          method in the ReUp Scanner API
        </li>
        <li>
          If the transaction is a success, the points have been decremented and
          the Customer can now pay the Vendor for the rest of the invoice if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the transaction fails, the Vendor should communicate this to the
          Customer by supplying their current points amount compared to how much the
          reward costs.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In the case where goods are not linked to ReUp rewards (ie EvaluateReward is
    not called), the Vendor must have knowledge of exactly what goods are
    to be redeem. Reward redemptions are limited to one per invoice.

    The role of the Scanner in an App reward + credit transaction is to allow

    In the case where goods are not linked to ReUp rewards (ie EvaluateReward is
    not called), the Vendor must have knowledge of exactly what goods are
    to be redeem. Reward redemptions are limited to one per invoice.

    For the case of when the Scanner is integrated with the POS, it is possible
    to do this transaction with only one scan, since the Redeem Reward QR Code
    holds sufficient information to do both transactions.

  <h2>Check In Only Transaction</h2>

    The role of the Scanner in an App check in only transaction is to allow the

  </p>
  <p>
    An App check in only transaction should consist of the following interactions:
